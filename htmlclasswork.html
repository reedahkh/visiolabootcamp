<p> The afternoon session started around 1 pm. Ms Elizabeth took us through the first lesson, which is introduction to web programming. <br> She taught us what html means and how to use the html for coding. <br> HTML means Hypertext amrkup Language and the basic tags for html are; 
<ol type="a"> 
<li> Doctype </li>
<li> Head </li>
<li> Body </li>
</ol> 
The class was very interactive because she gave us the opportunity to ask questions and stop her if we get lost. <br> At the end of the class, she gave us a classwork to design a basic webpage using all the things we learnt from her session. <br> We also learnt various html tags including;
<ul>
<li> Paragraph tag </li>
<li> Image tag </li>
<li> Line break </li> etc.
</ul>
